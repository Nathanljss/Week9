I struggled with this one a little to begin with but eventually pieced it all together using the previous workshops and demos

There is a user sign-in form from Clerk implemented

There isnt an error page when you try to open the profile page but it will make you log in instead

I tried to get all of the posts to display inside a Radix scroll box but couldnt get the posts to all sit inside it together. Each post kept rendering inside their own individual boxes that didnt work because the posts werent large enough.

Users can put their own information in about themselves on their profile page (Their name and a bio)

User posts are associated with their clerk id and their name that shows on their posts will actually be replaced by the name they enter on their profile page.
I wanted to make every username displayed in the posts a link to their individual profiles but couldnt figure out how to make it actually access that name and then render a page with their information.
I also wanted to create a form that will let the user change their display name and bio but when i got to that point I started feeling a bit overwhelmed and couldnt figure out the best way to go about it.

Im happy with the functionality I achieved so far but at the moment I feel like the project tested my knowledge so far.
